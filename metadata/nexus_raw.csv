05/09/24,22:37,Thanya Gayathri,"Yes, we are finally moving forward! 🎉 We have officially received permission from our Dean Sir for our much-anticipated Industrial Visit to Kerala! 🌴✨ The trip is scheduled to begin on October 3rd at 3:20 PM, and it’s going to be an unforgettable experience filled with fun and learning! The total fare is ₹7000, which covers all the essentials. Trip Coverage: •	Varkala •	Alleppey •	Kochi The tentative schedule has already been sent as a PDF, and the detailed itinerary for these places will be shared soon! Cost Breakdown: (May change) •	₹5500 – Covers travel, accommodation, food, and Wonderla entry ticket •	₹1000 – Train ticket fare •	₹500 – Includes entry fees for other visits, a medical first aid kit, water, etc. If we secure a concession, your total cost will be reduced by ₹500, making it ₹6500. In case of emergencies or additional visits, it’s a good idea to keep an extra ₹200 with you. Please note that the visiting places may change. Since everyone has already paid for the train tickets, you’ll only need to pay ₹6000 (or ₹5500 if the concession is available). Let’s get ready for an amazing journey together! For the remaining amount, forms will be circulated, and the amount will be collected by next week. If you haven’t joined yet, make sure to join by 12:00 PM.
