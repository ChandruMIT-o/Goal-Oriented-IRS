16/10/23,21:40,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"Not sure but, I think any dataset from UCI would do, I did for heart disease....if you can do for diabetes."
16/10/23,21:40,Udith,ohh 😮 are you sure?
16/10/23,21:52,God Rameez Akther,IG we have to do for only UCI Diabetes

16/10/23,21:53,God Rameez Akther,for that PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset you have to 'must' do data preprocessing since some of the insulin values are '0' which is not possible Refer the above notebook for preprocessing <This message was edited>
16/10/23,22:05,Iesa,Okayy
16/10/23,22:05,Iesa,Thanks
17/10/23,17:06,Pragadesh,Guys do we have any qps for DS

17/10/23,17:24,Udith,are we the first batch attending FDS?
17/10/23,17:25,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"No, Many Data scientists have already done their UG here 😂"
17/10/23,17:25,Surya K S,Seniors might have had this for their professional elective 🤷🏻‍♂️
17/10/23,17:26,Surya K S,Not sure
17/10/23,17:26,Udith,"I don't know, when you guys started cracking nut jokes like surya 😂"
17/10/23,17:26,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,I guess AZ courses are 80% newly released for us only....
17/10/23,17:26,Surya K S,Don't drag me unnecessarily bruh🤨
17/10/23,17:27,Udith,sorry chelo 😂🫂
17/10/23,17:27,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,But the probability is low....kindly check with someone....snr.
17/10/23,17:27,Surya K S,Okay 🫂🫂
17/10/23,17:27,Surya K S,I have checked they don't have it seems
17/10/23,17:28,Surya K S,So probably we are the first so.. 😂 All the best!
17/10/23,17:28,Aryan Prakash,See this is a new subject only. This is basically a culmination of many subject put together as one. Soo no papers for it.
17/10/23,17:29,Iesa,And it'll be like this from now on
17/10/23,17:29,Iesa,So deal with it 😂
17/10/23,17:30,Iesa,Mirsha go generate qn paper from chatgpt
17/10/23,18:01,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"If I have time, I would definitely...😂"
17/10/23,19:50,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Can anyone send a new problem worked out for PCA for quick revision...?
17/10/23,19:53,Udith,I haven't done anything new.... anyone else?

17/10/23,20:10,Iesa,Maybe simple plotting will come
17/10/23,20:10,Iesa,Whatever he's given in notes ig
17/10/23,20:22,Udith,"shoot, will we get codes? only theory and some problems know?"

17/10/23,21:45,Iesa,IMG-20231017-WA0003.jpg (file attached)
17/10/23,21:46,Iesa,Why are we randomly equating the 1st equation to 1
17/10/23,21:46,Iesa,Instead of solving equations 1 and 2
17/10/23,21:47,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"Eigen vectors are the least directional ratios, so You just take the proportions, can also take 2,3 but least should be there (1) and not 0. <This message was edited>"
17/10/23,21:47,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Send the entire problem.
17/10/23,21:49,Iesa,But why specifically eqn 1 and not 2
17/10/23,21:49,Iesa,Makes no sense
17/10/23,21:52,Udith,I guess while finding U1 vector one sir has used equation one and I worked out to find U2 using equation 2 and i got it right ...
17/10/23,21:53,Udith,i too had that same doubt
17/10/23,21:53,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"I think both will equate in a similar answer, try it out"
17/10/23,21:54,Iesa,Let's try
17/10/23,21:54,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Both are 0 !
17/10/23,21:54,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Can take any 1.
17/10/23,21:55,Iesa,Math is not mathing
17/10/23,21:57,Iesa,But calculating e2 works properly
17/10/23,21:57,Iesa,Somehow
17/10/23,22:07,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"IMG-20231017-WA0004.jpg (file attached) If considered eqn 2 , the direction is swapped, thats it.....according entire things get swapped, which should be 💯"
17/10/23,22:27,Iesa,Ahh ok
17/10/23,22:27,Iesa,Cool cool
17/10/23,22:27,Iesa,Denks
17/10/23,22:28,Udith,guys we are finding new points for the dataset using only e1 vector
17/10/23,22:29,Udith,what about e2 should we find for it too?
17/10/23,22:30,Iesa,Yess!
17/10/23,22:30,Iesa,"Then ig ( PC(1,1), PC(2,1) ) <This message was edited>"
17/10/23,22:31,Iesa,Is the new point
17/10/23,22:31,Iesa,Similar for 2 to 4
17/10/23,22:31,Iesa,Can someone confirm this?
17/10/23,22:34,Udith,yes iesa exactly
17/10/23,22:35,Udith,"where I got stuck was he just found only pc1 in class and went directly to plot the graph, I don't know how be plotted the data with only one point PC1"
17/10/23,22:35,Udith,yes this is right
17/10/23,22:35,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"Hey, Guius aim is to reduce it to 1D not 2D TO 2D."
17/10/23,22:35,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,think!
17/10/23,22:36,Pragadesh,So how to plot the final graph
17/10/23,22:36,Udith,oh 😯 wait I got it
17/10/23,22:36,Pragadesh,What are the x and y points
17/10/23,22:36,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Pc 1 has max variance and it represents appr accurate.
17/10/23,22:36,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,No y points.
17/10/23,22:36,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Bye!
17/10/23,22:37,Udith,it would be like this I guess.....
17/10/23,22:38,Udith,IMG-20231017-WA0005.jpg (file attached) still something is missing right?
17/10/23,22:38,Udith,I think this may be wrong did anyone draw what sir had drawn that day?
17/10/23,22:41,Iesa,Then should we plot for PC2 line or no
17/10/23,22:54,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,IMG-20231017-WA0006.jpg (file attached)
17/10/23,22:54,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,No!
17/10/23,22:55,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,What happened to you all suddenly?
18/10/23,06:28,Surya K S,"Guys do we need to study data cube aggregation, data compression and the following stuffs?"
18/10/23,06:28,Ithikash,Same doubt
18/10/23,06:28,Surya K S,🫡
18/10/23,06:29,Ithikash,I think yes Because sir told upto Pca in the pdf
18/10/23,06:29,Ithikash,data cube comes before Pca
18/10/23,06:30,Surya K S,Actually he just gone through these topics without explaining the things!... 🥲
18/10/23,06:31,Surya K S,So I too just gonna go through such topics 😂..
18/10/23,06:31,Surya K S,Byee
18/10/23,06:31,Ithikash,😂
18/10/23,07:06,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Should we have to write anything for DL CO lab?
18/10/23,07:07,Chandru,He didn't mention about the other exercises.
18/10/23,07:08,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,IMG-20231018-WA0000.jpg (file attached) Highlight !
18/10/23,07:08,Chandru,Typical. 😂
18/10/23,07:09,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"As representatives you guius have to do that @918148124727  But I'm requesting for student's sake, can you reps take some concern on students @918148124727"
18/10/23,07:13,Udith,once a rep always a rep 🔥🔥
18/10/23,07:13,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"Kindly inform all the reps, they have the ability to negotiate portions and timings with faculty....and our Faculty members are quite considerate."
18/10/23,07:13,Chandru,Again Typical Mirsha Behaviour. 😂
18/10/23,07:15,Surya K S,Will try to do so in future!😂👍🏻
18/10/23,18:34,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Is anyone preparing answer key for PCA qn  today?
18/10/23,18:35,Ramya M Nagaiah,🙋🏻‍♀️
18/10/23,18:35,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"Even I am preparing, let's cross verify ....."
18/10/23,18:36,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Sometime later.
18/10/23,18:51,Iesa,Can someone send yesterday's DBMS notes ?

18/10/23,21:55,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Acknowledge after checking ! <This message was edited>
18/10/23,21:58,Iesa,N1 and N2 should be orthogonal no?
18/10/23,21:58,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,On plotting both are perfectly orthogonal.
18/10/23,22:00,Iesa,I got a different answer tho
18/10/23,22:00,Iesa,Idk
18/10/23,22:01,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,What answer? Both had 0.8 something ?
18/10/23,22:01,Iesa,I got the answer like how we got in class
18/10/23,22:01,Iesa,Values and sign swapped
18/10/23,22:02,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,See the -sign can be taken to either x or with y !  is that all the difference you got ?
18/10/23,22:03,Iesa,For N2 I got the reverse of N1 with some sign changes
18/10/23,22:04,Udith,I have no guts to open it sorry
18/10/23,22:05,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Are the roots okay?
18/10/23,22:05,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,E values ?
18/10/23,22:11,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,IMG-20231018-WA0008.jpg (file attached) Tell me now.
18/10/23,22:11,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,DBMS till what we have to study?
18/10/23,22:11,Udith,whole 2
18/10/23,22:11,Udith,right?
18/10/23,22:11,Iesa,Even 5 NF?
18/10/23,22:11,Iesa,And join dependencies ?
18/10/23,22:11,Udith,yes ma'am taught it
18/10/23,22:11,Iesa,Oh great
18/10/23,22:11,Udith,she just gave a glance
19/10/23,20:17,Udith,guys normal forms is confusing me to the core... any materials to understand it easily?
19/10/23,20:19,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Same here.
19/10/23,20:19,Surya K S,Jenny's lecture!
19/10/23,20:19,Udith,yeah she is confusing more...
19/10/23,20:20,Surya K S,Ooh
19/10/23,20:20,Udith,like yeah she is clear but it is difficult when relations differ

19/10/23,20:20,Aryan Prakash,Vdo playlist of all normal forms
19/10/23,20:20,Aryan Prakash,It’s good for explanation and understanding
19/10/23,20:21,Udith,thanks Aryan maybe I will run those videos in 2x 😅
19/10/23,21:40,Iesa,Did ma'am teach how to convert from lower to higher Normal Form?
19/10/23,21:41,Udith,nope I don't think so
19/10/23,21:41,Chandru,Nope.
19/10/23,21:41,Iesa,So will it come?
19/10/23,21:41,Chandru,Yes.

19/10/23,21:43,Iesa,Ok whatever
19/10/23,21:43,Chandru,Only from 1 NF to 3Nf.
19/10/23,21:43,Iesa,Ok
19/10/23,21:44,Chandru,"For this conversion alone only upto 3NF (Mostly). But, you have to study all normal forms anyways."
19/10/23,21:44,Iesa,Ok
19/10/23,22:17,Pragadesh,Do we have to read Embedded SQL
19/10/23,22:17,Iesa,What's that 😂
19/10/23,22:17,Pragadesh,Idk
19/10/23,22:18,Aryan Prakash,Ma’am didn’t teach that shit 🤡
19/10/23,22:18,Pragadesh,1st lesson last topic
19/10/23,22:18,Iesa,We're already suffering
19/10/23,22:18,Aryan Prakash,Yesss
19/10/23,22:19,Pragadesh,Seri ok do we have to see codes for  triggers or just mere concept
19/10/23,22:19,Iesa,For triggers see code
19/10/23,22:32,Udith,and cursors too
20/10/23,14:10,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,<Media omitted>
20/10/23,19:17,Iesa,How should we write truth table for DLCO 4 bit binary adder and sub ?
20/10/23,19:18,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Somebody pleasebsend DLCO all exps record.
20/10/23,19:18,Iesa,Aka Ramesh 🫡
20/10/23,19:19,Chandru,You got record notebook?
20/10/23,19:58,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Yes.
21/10/23,15:10,God Rameez Akther,For the DLCO record upto Karnaugh map right?

21/10/23,15:32,Chandru,<Media omitted> DL and co.pdf
21/10/23,15:33,Chandru,Some values in truth table are wrong. Careful.
22/10/23,11:13,Surya K S,IMG-20231022-WA0000.jpg (file attached) Left me in seen🥲🥲
22/10/23,11:14,Surya K S,What to do!

25/10/23,20:05,Iesa,It seems fine but idk if it's correct 😂
25/10/23,20:06,Iesa,You can't leave it like theta( n^(log2)) ?
25/10/23,20:06,Iesa,Base 3
25/10/23,20:06,God Rameez Akther,No ig
25/10/23,20:07,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Or can we put big O of n
25/10/23,20:07,God Rameez Akther,Eh?
25/10/23,20:07,God Rameez Akther,For what
25/10/23,20:07,Iesa,Yeah that also works
25/10/23,20:07,Iesa,You're taking upper bound
25/10/23,20:08,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"Theta means accurate, big o means approximate upper bound right?"
25/10/23,20:08,Iesa,Cuz you took ceil no
25/10/23,20:08,God Rameez Akther,Ohh
25/10/23,20:08,Iesa,Big oh seems more appropriate
25/10/23,20:08,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Big Ohh !
25/10/23,20:08,Ithikash,Yep
25/10/23,20:08,Iesa,Dei 😂
25/10/23,20:09,Iesa,How to prove 2n != o(n)
25/10/23,20:09,Iesa,Small oh
25/10/23,20:09,God Rameez Akther,Bye bye
25/10/23,20:10,Iesa,Oh nvm

25/10/23,20:21,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,But it is = to big o of n right?
25/10/23,20:23,Iesa,Yes
25/10/23,20:30,Iesa,Do we have to see master theorem proof?
25/10/23,20:30,Aryan Prakash,Yes
25/10/23,21:59,Iesa,IMG-20231025-WA0008.jpg (file attached)
25/10/23,22:00,Iesa,Is the answer O(n^3 logn )
25/10/23,22:00,Iesa,Can someone verify?
25/10/23,22:01,Iesa,I used recursion tree
25/10/23,22:02,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Isn't it n^2 log ^2 n?
25/10/23,22:03,Pragadesh,That's what iam thinking too
25/10/23,22:03,Aryan Prakash,Yess not n^3
25/10/23,22:04,Iesa,How
25/10/23,22:04,Aryan Prakash,Formula my guy
25/10/23,22:04,Aryan Prakash,Apply it and check
25/10/23,22:07,Iesa,Can someone work out ples
25/10/23,22:08,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,IMG-20231025-WA0010.jpg (file attached) I'm gonna fail ig.
25/10/23,22:09,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Tougher thru tree 🎄

25/10/23,22:09,Iesa,Nice
25/10/23,22:09,Iesa,Got it
25/10/23,22:10,Iesa,So this will be big oh
25/10/23,22:10,Iesa,And not theta
26/10/23,06:11,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Theta we can take for this.
26/10/23,06:12,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Can somebody tell me how to take logbase 2 in calc
26/10/23,06:17,Pragadesh,Log ⁸base 2 means Log8 ÷ log 2
26/10/23,07:01,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Thank you.

30/10/23,19:58,Surya K S,But she already said that she will be giving the answers as well
30/10/23,19:59,God Rameez Akther,if any one wants the university schema as created tables and record values can use this <This message was edited>
30/10/23,19:59,Udith,dei what ra so many insert operations
30/10/23,19:59,God Rameez Akther,🧐
30/10/23,20:00,Iesa,I'm gonna use the uni schema and answer the qns ma'am gave

04/11/23,11:41,Surya K S,One doubt
04/11/23,11:41,Surya K S,"q,p->q => -p ah illa p ah?"
04/11/23,11:41,Ithikash,Negation p
04/11/23,11:41,Surya K S,Mirsha just wait for others...😂.. I have to cross check
04/11/23,11:42,Surya K S,Sure?
04/11/23,11:42,Ithikash,Yep
04/11/23,11:42,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,How?
04/11/23,11:42,Surya K S,"Then -q,p->q?"
04/11/23,11:42,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,This only -p
04/11/23,11:42,Surya K S,Yep
04/11/23,11:42,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,🤡🤡🤡
04/11/23,11:42,Surya K S,I asked for this
04/11/23,11:43,Udith,i think it's P
04/11/23,11:43,Surya K S,Proof?
04/11/23,11:43,Udith,Ok lemme
04/11/23,11:43,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Kill me 🤡
04/11/23,11:45,Surya K S,🗡️🗡️
04/11/23,11:45,Udith,Hope this is correct 😂

04/11/23,11:46,Surya K S,🫡🫡
04/11/23,11:46,Ithikash,This is negation p
04/11/23,11:46,Surya K S,That I know da..;
04/11/23,11:47,Ithikash,M
04/11/23,11:47,Ithikash,😂Legend
04/11/23,11:47,Udith,😂😂
04/11/23,11:48,Udith,I don't know that thing came into my mind i thought it's P
04/11/23,11:52,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"Simpel proofe  If ~q, p->q gives ~p na, q is nothing but (negation of ~q) which should give (negation of ~q, p->q) which is p."
04/11/23,11:52,Udith,even though I didn't understand it is same as my answer so 😂
04/11/23,11:53,Udith,yeah guys it's P not negation P
04/11/23,11:53,Ithikash,P is the answer But I can't accept this proof😂😂
04/11/23,11:53,Udith,then accept my proof 😂
04/11/23,11:53,Ithikash,🫡
04/11/23,11:53,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Why?
04/11/23,11:54,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,This is the most logical proof possible for this.

05/11/23,12:04,Surya K S,Its neither P nor -P...we can't derive that..
05/11/23,12:04,Ramya M Nagaiah,Yeah.

07/11/23,20:05,Iesa,I didn't write it
07/11/23,20:08,Iesa,How to write the truth table for BCD adder ?
07/11/23,20:08,Udith,leave a page 😂

07/11/23,20:14,Iesa,Doesn't make sense
07/11/23,20:14,Udith,that looks like BCD value of each decimal number that ain't truth table
07/11/23,20:14,God Rameez Akther,same
07/11/23,20:14,Iesa,"I think we should do 0+0, 1+1,..."
07/11/23,20:14,Iesa,In BCD form
07/11/23,20:14,Udith,yes these are just values
07/11/23,20:15,God Rameez Akther,It is better to leave a page

26/11/23,12:14,God Rameez Akther,idk
26/11/23,12:14,God Rameez Akther,the question might be wrong
26/11/23,12:15,God Rameez Akther,how can the same 4 be three greater than the input and two less than the input??
26/11/23,13:44,Iesa,Yeah
26/11/23,13:44,Iesa,It's wrong
27/11/23,20:36,Iesa,Guys can SVM be used for more then 2 class classification?
27/11/23,20:36,Iesa,Than*
27/11/23,20:45,Udith,"I don't think so, it best suit for binary"
27/11/23,20:46,Udith,guys I just have a doubt could anyone check for diabetes dataset what accuracy you have got?
27/11/23,20:47,Udith,I am getting only 75%?
27/11/23,21:04,Pragadesh,Zihaths getting 0.993
27/11/23,21:10,Chandru,I got 80% max for this diabetes dataset.
27/11/23,21:10,Chandru,Are you sure that's for PIMA Indian diabetes?
27/11/23,21:14,Iesa,Using what classifier?
27/11/23,21:14,Chandru,svm only.
27/11/23,21:15,Chandru,Yes.
27/11/23,21:16,Iesa,How did you tune it
27/11/23,21:16,Iesa,By variyring random state?
27/11/23,21:17,Chandru,"Yes. Also, I tried to give equal amount of records with 1 and 0 for training."
27/11/23,21:17,Chandru,"But, that doesn't really matter I guess."
27/11/23,21:17,Iesa,Ahhh
27/11/23,21:17,Iesa,Maybe we can do a frequency count
27/11/23,21:17,Iesa,And then do 80 20 split
27/11/23,21:17,Iesa,Within each class
27/11/23,21:18,Iesa,Is that what you did?
27/11/23,21:18,Chandru,"That's not what I did. But, that's also a good idea."
27/11/23,21:18,Iesa,Cuz there might be more 1's than 0's maybe
27/11/23,21:18,Iesa,Lemme try
27/11/23,21:18,Chandru,"There are, yes."
27/11/23,21:20,Iesa,What's the function for counting ?
27/11/23,21:20,Iesa,Series.?
27/11/23,21:20,Iesa,Or DataFrame. ?
27/11/23,21:20,Chandru,"There are like a hundred different ways to do. But, this is what I did."
27/11/23,21:20,Chandru,"tempX = df[df['Outcome']==1] tempY = df[df['Outcome']==0]  XTrain1, xTest1, YTrain1, yTest1 = train_test_split(tempX[cols.drop('Outcome')], tempX['Outcome'], test_size=0.2, random_state=1) XTrain2, xTest2, YTrain2, yTest2 = train_test_split(tempY[cols.drop('Outcome')], tempY['Outcome'], test_size=0.57, random_state=1)  XTrain = pd.concat([XTrain1,XTrain2],ignore_index=True) xTest = pd.concat([xTest1,xTest2],ignore_index=True) YTrain = pd.concat([YTrain1,YTrain2],ignore_index=True) yTest = pd.concat([yTest1,yTest2],ignore_index=True)"

24/12/23,12:47,Pragadesh,Roger that cap!
24/12/23,12:55,Rhithik,hey in the first problem the knap sack capacity is given as 50 so the entire vegetables will fit inside the bag
24/12/23,12:55,Rhithik,is it 5??
24/12/23,12:56,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Isn't it profit per kg? <This message was edited>
24/12/23,13:00,Rhithik,No thats just given as profit
24/12/23,13:01,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,I think this one is unbound knapsack.
24/12/23,13:01,Rhithik,No the weights are too less for the total capacity of the knapsack
24/12/23,13:01,Rhithik,I will just make the capcity as 5 and solve the problem then
24/12/23,13:02,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"Dei, we need to put max vegies repeated covering all vegs thats it."
24/12/23,13:03,Rhithik,Ama da knapsack capacity 50 nu kuduthu irukku and weights kammi aa irukku
24/12/23,13:04,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Repeat all veges....fill again
24/12/23,13:05,Rhithik,Nee soldra maari panna naa just profit per kg calculate pannitu andha single vegetable a full ah 50 kg ku fill pannidlamae
24/12/23,13:05,Rhithik,😂

24/12/23,14:38,Udith,ohhh noice
24/12/23,14:38,Udith,so converting into 2 variables right
24/12/23,14:38,Iesa,Yeah
24/12/23,14:38,Iesa,Basically
24/12/23,14:38,Iesa,Just check if I did it correct and proceed
24/12/23,14:39,Udith,but what happens to the third variable's value? after finding both the 2 values we can substitute in that eqn to get the 3rd right
24/12/23,14:39,Iesa,Yes

24/12/23,19:23,Udith,ok 5 mins I am trying it
24/12/23,19:24,Rhithik,"To convert the linear program into standard form, we need to ensure that all inequalities are written as equations and that all variables are non-negative.  The given linear program is:  Maximize Z = x1 + x2 + x3  Subject to: 1. 3x1 - 2x2 ≤ 7 2. x2 + 4x3 ≥ 10 3. x1 + x2 = 2  To convert it into standard form:  1. Rewrite the first inequality as an equation by adding a non-negative slack variable, s1: 3x1 - 2x2 + s1 = 7  2. Rewrite the second inequality as an equation by subtracting a non-negative surplus variable, s2: x2 + 4x3 - s2 = 10  3. For the third equation, it is already an equation.  4. Add non-negativity constraints for all variables: x1, x2, x3, s1, s2 ≥ 0  Now, the linear program in standard form is:  Maximize Z = x1 + x2 + x3  Subject to: 1. 3x1 - 2x2 + s1 = 7 2. x2 + 4x3 - s2 = 10 3. x1 + x2 = 2 4. x1, x2, x3, s1, s2 ≥ 0  This standard form can be solved using the simplex algorithm."
24/12/23,19:25,Rhithik,By chatgpt
24/12/23,19:25,Udith,so leaving that 3rd constraint
24/12/23,19:26,Rhithik,Not sure
24/12/23,19:26,Udith,ok another question how to choose non slack from z all have the same coefficient

17/01/24,16:43,Chandru,Dividing by n−1 instead of n corrects for this by accounting for the fact that you've used one degree of freedom to estimate the sample mean.

17/01/24,16:45,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,But why he taught like N-1 IN FORMULA FOR SOLVING SUM?
17/01/24,16:45,Chandru,Exactly!

17/01/24,16:46,Rhithik,We never used standard deviation in our class i guess
17/01/24,16:46,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"Yeah, Thats right, but TAKE ALL YOUTUBERS VIDEO, EVERYWHERE N-1 FOR PCA ANOL, even in this like that only. Sir refers youtube, what we do now?"
17/01/24,16:46,Rhithik,Idhula they gave sample in question
17/01/24,16:46,Chandru,Here they have specified it as a sample. That's why I guess. 😅
17/01/24,16:46,Rhithik,That’s why we are dividing by n-1
17/01/24,16:47,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,What bout PCA🤡
17/01/24,16:50,Pragadesh,Just do PCA as PCA don't change anything there

17/01/24,23:01,Pragadesh,"Information-Based Learning:  Handling Alternative Feature Selection: This involves choosing the most relevant features from your dataset to build a predictive model. Methods include filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods.  Impurity Metrics: In decision tree algorithms, impurity metrics (e.g., Gini impurity, entropy) are used to determine the homogeneity of a node. These metrics guide the decision tree in selecting the best features to split the data.  Similarity-Based Learning:  Feature Space: In similarity-based learning, data points are often represented in a feature space, where each feature represents a different aspect of the data. Similarity measures, like cosine similarity, can then be applied to determine the similarity between data points.  Predicting Continuous Targets: Similarity-based methods can be used for predicting continuous targets by finding data points similar to the one being predicted and averaging or weighting their target values.  Error-Based Learning:  Measuring Error: Error-based learning involves quantifying the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. Common error metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and others, depending on the nature of the problem.  Error Surfaces: The error surface is a representation of how the error changes with respect to the model's parameters. Visualizing the error surface helps in understanding the behavior of the learning algorithm and finding the optimal parameter values."

18/01/24,19:34,Pragadesh,Considering X Y i obtained a schedule
18/01/24,19:35,Pragadesh,And z tells t1 comes after t2 which is also right since T2 ->T3-> T1
18/01/24,19:35,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"Yeah, answer is correct this time. Even I wrote the same, but is this method of discarding 1 confusable variable okay to use?"
18/01/24,19:35,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"Okay, thanks 🙏"

29/01/24,22:07,Ithikash,It is almost a bedtime
29/01/24,22:07,Ithikash,Don't worry tomo also no one reply 😂😂
29/01/24,22:07,God Rameez Akther,As if you guy's sleep before 10 o clock
29/01/24,22:07,Surya K S,That's for me actually! Who cares😂.
29/01/24,22:12,Udith,😂😂
29/01/24,22:14,Pragadesh,Use reaction u pitch
29/01/24,22:14,Udith,cricket pitch huh da pragadesh 😅 using foul language huh
30/01/24,10:51,Pragadesh,guys register pannitan
30/01/24,11:20,Udith,me and my frnds also registered
30/01/24,11:53,Iesa,I registered too
31/01/24,10:13,Udith,guys does anyone have notes for LUP decomposition and also for finding inverse and determinant..
31/01/24,12:07,Iesa,I'm referring your notes only 🤡
31/01/24,12:09,Udith,these things aren't there in my notes
31/01/24,12:10,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Can any of you send🤡 SIMPLEX🤡 algorithm and 🎶🎵
31/01/24,12:11,Iesa,IMG-20240131-WA0009.jpg (file attached)
31/01/24,12:11,Iesa,That's all no?
31/01/24,12:11,Udith,cool how to find inverse
31/01/24,12:12,Udith,by this?
31/01/24,12:12,Udith,IMG-20240131-WA0010.jpg (file attached)
31/01/24,12:13,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,I have Only One doubt. Instead of finding L inv and U inv and multiplying why cant we directly find A inv.
31/01/24,12:13,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Clown 🤡 🌍
31/01/24,12:13,Iesa,Use row / column transformations
31/01/24,12:13,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,?
31/01/24,12:13,Udith,you mean this right.. this is row col transformation I mean this is gaussian elimination method
31/01/24,12:14,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Can we use 1 / det L x adj L?
31/01/24,12:14,Udith,those are kindergarten methods to solve ma'am won't give marks
31/01/24,12:15,Udith,they will specify the method
31/01/24,12:15,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Okay.
31/01/24,12:16,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Actually method said by me is difficult than gaussian eliminaation method !
31/01/24,12:16,Udith,yes gaussian elimination method is difficult but what if ma'am didn't give us marks
31/01/24,13:07,Iesa,https://byjus.com/maths/inverse-of-a-matrix-by-elementary-operations/
31/01/24,13:41,Iesa,IMG-20240131-WA0012.jpg (file attached) Is this correct? Random example
31/01/24,13:42,Udith,correct but it's still a bit confusing instead of this it's better to use gaussian
31/01/24,13:42,Udith,it's fine tho
31/01/24,13:43,Iesa,How to do gaussian thing ?
31/01/24,13:45,Udith,same like this you have done row transformation right same
31/01/24,13:45,Udith,..
31/01/24,13:45,Iesa,Okayy
31/01/24,14:55,Iesa,Can you guys send whatever notes you have for unit 5 please?
31/01/24,14:57,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,There is somethin called SIMPLEX
31/01/24,15:03,Iesa,Do we need to learn algorithm?
31/01/24,15:11,Udith,last time they asked us in assessment
31/01/24,15:11,Udith,who is setting the paper? ma'am?
31/01/24,15:11,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Obviously.
31/01/24,15:12,Rhithik,subject code is it5402 <This message was edited>
31/01/24,15:12,Rhithik,so it is a common paper i guess
31/01/24,15:13,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"Deiiii, but no other have DAA chk timetable."
31/01/24,15:13,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Only AI DS. Special
31/01/24,15:13,Rhithik,then it is fine
31/01/24,15:13,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,How to calculate L inverse in L U. U inverse is fine.
31/01/24,15:28,Pragadesh,I searched but no algorithm type but we have to someone send if u got
31/01/24,15:31,God Rameez Akther,Can someone send a fully solved LUP decomposition problem please
31/01/24,18:00,Iesa,IMG-20240131-WA0016.jpg (file attached)
31/01/24,18:00,Iesa,IMG-20240131-WA0014.jpg (file attached)

31/01/24,18:01,Iesa,Found simplex in book 🫠
31/01/24,18:01,Iesa,Maybe just learn this
31/01/24,18:56,Udith,guys can someone verify that both maximize and minimise is done in the same way
31/01/24,18:56,God Rameez Akther,No
31/01/24,18:56,Udith,I did minimisation problem with the same max problem steps and still got the answer
31/01/24,18:56,Udith,then how
31/01/24,18:57,God Rameez Akther,IMG-20240131-WA0018.jpg (file attached) Did you solve this problem
31/01/24,18:57,Udith,yeah ez
31/01/24,18:57,God Rameez Akther,What's the answer
31/01/24,18:57,Udith,i know but I didn't work it out 😂 gimme 5 mins
31/01/24,18:57,God Rameez Akther,🫠
31/01/24,18:57,Iesa,There's no answer
31/01/24,18:57,God Rameez Akther,I do not know whether I am fully correct
31/01/24,18:58,God Rameez Akther,But it includes the use of artificial variable and surplus variable
31/01/24,18:58,God Rameez Akther,Not just basic slack variable
31/01/24,18:58,God Rameez Akther,There is answer
31/01/24,18:59,God Rameez Akther,But it is difficult and mam did not teach that thing
31/01/24,18:59,Iesa,Simplex calculator says no answer
31/01/24,18:59,God Rameez Akther,It says there is answer
31/01/24,18:59,God Rameez Akther,You might be using potato calculator
31/01/24,19:00,God Rameez Akther,https://linprog.com/en/main-simplex-method
31/01/24,19:00,God Rameez Akther,this gives pakka answer <This message was edited>
31/01/24,19:01,God Rameez Akther,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlxMTXdkcmw&t=327s
31/01/24,19:01,God Rameez Akther,idk whether he is correct or wrong and also I can't understand his steps fully
31/01/24,19:02,God Rameez Akther,but that standard form is correct I guess (in this video)
31/01/24,19:02,God Rameez Akther,Also SOMEBODY SEND LUP PROBLEM FULLY SOLVED ONE PLEASEEEEE!
31/01/24,19:03,God Rameez Akther,Answer bruh?
31/01/24,19:04,Udith,😳😳
31/01/24,19:04,God Rameez Akther,ez it seems
31/01/24,19:04,Udith,bois I am working under pressure right you shouldn't disturb me with your messagess 😂
31/01/24,19:04,Udith,yes yes 😅😭
31/01/24,19:07,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Ohh nice.
31/01/24,19:07,Udith,rameez got a bit problem here

31/01/24,19:07,God Rameez Akther,😏
31/01/24,19:08,Udith,3 variables but only 2 inequalities 🙂
31/01/24,19:08,God Rameez Akther,Eh?
31/01/24,19:08,God Rameez Akther,Why not
31/01/24,19:09,God Rameez Akther,Jus leave it
31/01/24,19:09,Udith,you sure
31/01/24,19:09,Udith,ok is this right or?
31/01/24,19:09,God Rameez Akther,It can't be solved through normal procedure
31/01/24,19:09,Udith,but my question is different
31/01/24,19:10,Udith,what if the same problem which ma'am thought us in class what if it is minimisation instead of max
31/01/24,19:10,Udith,"I did solve it with same max steps and got the right answer , I just wanna check if you guys did"
31/01/24,19:14,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,What's being happened here? Explain to us also.
31/01/24,19:15,Pragadesh,Yes

31/01/24,20:03,Chandru,"Wait, you can do that?"
31/01/24,20:03,Chandru,How does this whole thing works again?
31/01/24,20:47,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"IMG-20240131-WA0024.jpg (file attached) I can't comprehend, what does this mean? Is Sir in NSS campsite or somewhere else?"
31/01/24,20:48,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"So, NO ONE is selfless enough to teach me SIMPLEX ? THANK YOU GUYS."
01/02/24,07:23,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Guys vote in KKKKK and tell all your friends to vote there. (NSS only)
01/02/24,08:49,Rhithik,IMG-20240201-WA0002.jpg (file attached) this problem is a normal task scheduling problem right??
01/02/24,08:49,Rhithik,or is it different?
01/02/24,08:50,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Twisted 🥨 version of the same
01/02/24,08:50,Rhithik,no my doubt is whether we have to maximise or minimise the penalty
01/02/24,08:51,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,You have to ensure that your company becomes bankrupt as quickly as possible🤡😭
01/02/24,08:52,Rhithik,they have given maximum penalty. does that mean we have to choose the tasks with maximum penalty first??
01/02/24,08:52,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,No the opposite. <This message was edited>
01/02/24,08:52,Rhithik,then what is the twist there

01/02/24,08:56,Surya K S,Seems like they will take us there!
01/02/24,08:56,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"Yeah, if we all cooperately say that we come on 3rd na, Veerabadran sir is okay with it.... but we have write a letter and sign by all ...."
01/02/24,08:56,Surya K S,Even it's okay if they take us la?
01/02/24,08:57,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"By the way, I forgot that our class has 0 COOPERATION and call for action."
01/02/24,08:57,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,Then fine we'll go by 2nd evening itself.
01/02/24,08:58,Surya K S,Yeah if they have made arrangements! Then it will be easy for us!.. I'll let you know by confirming with others!

01/02/24,12:21,Rhithik,Just check if this method is correct for finding inverse
01/02/24,12:21,Rhithik,Leave the calculations just check the method
01/02/24,12:22,Udith,yeah this is the method many mentioned in YouTube
01/02/24,12:23,Udith,but ma'am mark poduvangale ithuku

01/02/24,16:52,Iesa,What all proofs are we supposed to study?
01/02/24,16:52,Iesa,Do we have to learn stuff after clique?
01/02/24,19:29,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"IMG-20240201-WA0016.jpg (file attached) Sir itself called me and told that Better come by 3rd morning. Special full attendance given to AI DS , Sir told to tell seniors that Veerabadran sir told like this and ask permission...?"

11/02/24,20:34,God Rameez Akther,Follow the comments present in this
11/02/24,20:34,God Rameez Akther,We can use both sides
11/02/24,20:34,God Rameez Akther,Like DBMS observation
11/02/24,20:35,God Rameez Akther,For the first exercise no need any code and output
11/02/24,20:35,Udith,rameez is this for softcopy or for Dv lab observation
11/02/24,20:35,God Rameez Akther,Just syntax and explanation
11/02/24,20:35,God Rameez Akther,No no no
11/02/24,20:35,God Rameez Akther,She didn't say any format
11/02/24,20:35,God Rameez Akther,Need to ask her
11/02/24,20:35,God Rameez Akther,Just write observation for now
11/02/24,20:35,Udith,ok is this for observation
11/02/24,20:36,God Rameez Akther,Also not sure of the heading thing
11/02/24,20:36,God Rameez Akther,Just leave space
11/02/24,20:36,Udith,for softcopy they said to choose dataset and perform visualization stuffs
11/02/24,20:36,Udith,right?
11/02/24,20:36,God Rameez Akther,That is different
11/02/24,20:36,God Rameez Akther,It's just for the sake of learning
11/02/24,20:37,Udith,ok
11/02/24,20:38,God Rameez Akther,Rathasenthil (i gues that's her name) mam only barged in and told that each individual should choose one random dataset and work on it in jupyter notebook (the things that we did on last sem) and she will ask each and everyone it seems
11/02/24,20:39,Udith,yeah so that's the soft copy right

02/09/24,23:07,Chandru,POLL: Choose Wisely OPTION: Go tell RSK ma'am that these works are hectic. (0 votes) OPTION: Finish her off. (1 vote)
02/09/24,23:09,Iesa,But she's expecting too much within short time span
02/09/24,23:09,Iesa,We'll ask her to give only assignments from now on
02/09/24,23:09,Iesa,We'll ask her to cancel the flask project
02/09/24,23:14,Mirsha Morningstar AKM,"No need . We'll show our dbms flask project, better cut short something else."

11/09/24,18:45,Chandru,Nah.
11/09/24,18:45,Pragadesh,What abt coca cola and her sums 😂
11/09/24,18:45,Chandru,Those are really simple problems if you think about it. She will probably ask the same questions in the book.
11/09/24,18:47,Pragadesh,Okay then good
11/09/24,18:47,Chandru,"For ML, does anyone have any idea of what he has taught so far? 😂"

14/09/24,18:47,Iesa,"It should cover things like performance metrics, and anything related in our portions"
14/09/24,18:47,Iesa,One qn will definitely come from CRC

15/09/24,10:28,Pragadesh,11) You have to send three 16-bit words to a receiver as follows: Word 1: 1011101010011011 Word 2: 1110001110101010 Word 3: 1001011100010110 Calculate the checksum for these three words. Send the three words and the checksum to the receiver and confirm if there is any error at the receiver end using the checksum method.
