Must showcase everything we have done from experiment 1 to 9 in the software application ( like data cleaning, transformations, binning, clustering, PCA, color related stuffs), and every other concept included.\\n2. Can do the entire mini app project in Python, *BUT* there must be some plots made in R ( plots which are more visually pleasing than python preferred ) sample ratio can be 90 % in python and 10 % in R.\\n3. *NOTE :* The mini application must be encompassing an ALL AROUND PACKAGE. All the preprocessing stuffs, Data Visualisations and most importantly ( DEVELOP ML MODELS LIKE CLASSIFICATION, REGRESSION, DECISION, CURVES, ETC )\\n4. Stick solely to your team\\'s Dataset for now. ( Single dataset )\\n5. Can add a related dataset for testing generalization stuffs if needed.\\n23/04/24, 16:28 - Chandru: 1) Visualize the distribution of missing values and apply an appropriate imputation technique. Remove null values and justify the choice of imputation technique used.\\n\\n2) Identify outliers using suitable plotting techniques and justify the chosen visualization method. Evaluate the necessity of outlier removal, apply the technique if required, and re-visualize the data.\\n\\n3) Extract features that show a high correlation with the target variable using visualization techniques.\\n\\n4) Categorize features as Nominal, Ordinal, Discrete, and Continuous. Create one plot for each category to visualize the 1D features. (No repetitions.)\\n\\n5) Generate and explain three different plots:\\n\\n- Continuous vs Categorical\\n- Categorical vs Categorical\\n- Continuous vs Continuous\\n\\nJustify the choice of each plotting technique based on the nature of the variables being compared.\\n\\n6) Use a histogram or box plot to visualize the summary statistics of a selected feature.\\n\\n7) Apply data aggregation and filtering techniques to focus on specific aspects or segments of the data. Discuss how these transformations simplify the visualization while retaining crucial insights.\\n\\n8) Enhance a 2D plot by using colors to represent additional information, effectively capturing 3D aspects within a 2D visualization.\\n23/04/24, 16:30 - +91 90925 03099: Upto 7 experiments in the record and observation.
